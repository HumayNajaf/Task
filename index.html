                <p><b>Willem van Gogh</b> (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch <a

                    painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Europe">Western art</a>
                    history. In a period of 10 years, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
                    paintings, most of which date from
                    the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraits_by_Vincent_van_Gogh">portraits</a> and
                    self-portraits, and are characterised by
                    bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of
                    modern art. Not commercially
                    successful in his career, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, which eventually led to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Vincent_van_Gogh">his suicide</a> at age
                    thirty-seven.
                </p>

                <p>Born into an upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and
                    thoughtful.
                    As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was
                    transferred to
                    London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in predominantly Roman
                    Catholic
                    southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having
                    moved back
                    home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long
                    correspondence
                    by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few
                    signs of the
                    vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of
                    the
                    avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist
                    sensibility.
                    As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings
                    grew brighter
                    as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France
                    in 1888. During
                    this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)">olive trees</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Fields">wheat fields</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)">sunflowers</a> .
                    Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental
                    stability, he often
                    neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin
                    ended after a
                    confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in
                    psychiatric hospitals,
                    including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in
                    Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris,
                    he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted, and on 27
                    July 1890, Van Gogh is believed
                    to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.
                </p>

                <p>Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a
                    failure. As he became famous
                    only after his suicide, he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public imagination. His
                    reputation grew in the early
                    20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German
                    Expressionists. He attained widespread
                    critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but
                    tragic painter whose troubled
                    personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among
                    the world's most expensive
                    paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum
                    in Amsterdam, which holds
                    the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.</p>
                <h2 id="Letters">Letters</h2>
                <p>The most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger
                    brother, Theo. Their
                    lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are
                    recorded in the hundreds of
                    letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his
                    brother with financial and
                    emotional support as well as access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.</p>

                <p>Theo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; but Vincent kept only a few of the letters he received.
                    After both had
                    died, Theo's widow Jo Bonger-van Gogh arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few
                    appeared in 1906 and
                    1913; the majority were published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have
                    been described
                    as having a "diary-like intimacy", and read in parts like autobiography. Translator Arnold Pomerans
                    wrote that their
                    publication adds a "fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an
                    understanding granted to us
                    by virtually no other painter".</p>
                <h2 id="Life">Life</h2>
                <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic
                    province of North
                    Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a
                    minister of the
                    Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the
                    name of his grandfather
                    and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van
                    Gogh family. The
                    name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology
                    graduate at the
                    University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may
                    have been named after
                    his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).</p>

                <p>Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague, and his father was the youngest son of
                    a minister. The two
                    met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van
                    Gogh's parents married
                    in May 1851, and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another
                    brother, Cor, and
                    three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as "Wil"). In later life, Van Gogh remained in
                    touch only with
                    Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasized the importance
                    of family to
                    the point of for those around her. Theodorus's salary as a minister was modest, but the Church also
                    supplied the
                    family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse; his mother Anna instilled
                    in the children a
                    duty to uphold the family's high social position.</p>

                <p>Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and
                    in 1860, was
                    sent to the village school. In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he
                    felt abandoned,
                    and he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in
                    Tilburg, where he was
                    also deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child
                    by his mother,
                    and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. Constant
                    Cornelis
                    Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy
                    was to reject
                    technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects.
                    Van Gogh's profound
                    unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868, he
                    abruptly returned
                    home. He later wrote that his youth was "austere and cold, and sterile".</p>

                <p>In July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in
                    The Hague. After
                    completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch on Southampton Street,
                    and took lodgings
                    at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and,
                    at 20, was earning
                    more than his father. Theo's wife, Jo Van Gogh-Bonger, later remarked that this was the best year of
                    Vincent's life.
                    He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but she rejected him after
                    confessing his feelings;
                    she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated and religiously fervent. His
                    father and uncle
                    arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to
                    which the art dealers
                    commodified art, and he was dismissed a year later.</p>

                <p>In April 1876, he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding
                    school in Ramsgate.
                    When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement was not
                    successful;
                    he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten;in 1876
                    he returned
                    home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the
                    position and spent his
                    time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French, and German. He immersed
                    himself in Christianity,
                    and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van
                    Görlitz, Van Gogh ate
                    frugally, avoiding meat.</p>

                <p>To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877, the family sent him
                    to live with his
                    uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected theologian, in Amsterdam. Van Gogh prepared for the University
                    of Amsterdam
                    theology entrance examination; he failed the exam and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He
                    undertook, but also
                    failed, a three-month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken, near Brussels.</p>

                <p>In January 1879, he took up a post as a missionary at Petit-Wasmes in the working class, coal-mining
                    district of Borinage
                    in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings
                    at a bakery to a
                    homeless person and moved to a small hut, where he slept on straw. His humble living conditions did
                    not endear him to
                    church authorities, who dismissed him for "undermining the dignity of the priesthood". He then
                    walked the 75 kilometres
                    (47 mi) to Brussels, returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but he gave in to pressure from
                    his parents to return
                    home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration for his
                    parents.
                    His father was especially frustrated, and advised that his son be committed to the lunatic asylum in
                    Geel.</p>
